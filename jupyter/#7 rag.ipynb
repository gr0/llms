      "### Key Points in the Code\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Axios Configuration**:\n",
      "   - We use the `axios` library for making HTTP requests.\n",
      "   - Authentication is done via Basic Auth using the `username` (your OmniPanel login) and `password` (your API key).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **API Request Body**:\n",
      "   - The `requestBody` is modeled after the JSON data in the provided curl example.\n",
      "   - You need to replace placeholders such as `'your_login_here'`, `'your_api_key_here'`, and `'https://webhook.site/your_callback_url_here'` with your actual credentials and callback URL.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **createConversation Function**:\n",
      "   - It sends a POST request to the Authologic API to start a new conversation.\n",
      "   - It logs the response from the API, which includes information like the new conversation's ID, user key, and verification URL.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Handling API Response**:\n",
      "   - The API response is destructured to easily access the conversation details.\n",
      "   - These details can be used to progress in the identity verification process by redirecting users to the provided URL.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Error Handling**:\n",
      "   - Potential errors during the API call are caught and logged for debugging purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "This code is a direct translation of the curl request into a TypeScript format, and it provides a foundational understanding of how to use the Authologic API programmatically. Be sure to fill in the placeholders with your actual data before running this script.\n"

    "\n",
    "We will use the curl tool to start a new conversation - one that will return the user first and last name. Keep in mind that the following example requires you to replace the my_login with the credentials that you can find in the OmniPanel and my_callback_url_here with an address that our system will return the data to.\n",
